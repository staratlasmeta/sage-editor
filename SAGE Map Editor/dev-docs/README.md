## Quick Start for Developers

1. **Understanding the Codebase**: Start with the [Architecture Overview](./architecture-overview.md) to understand the system design.

2. **Module Deep Dive**: Review the [Module Reference](./module-reference.md) for detailed information about each component.

3. **Data Handling**: Consult [Data Structures](./data-structures.md) to understand how data flows through the system.

4. **Making Changes**: Follow the [Development Guide](./development-guide.md) for best practices when modifying the code.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Rendering**: HTML5 Canvas API with high-DPI support
- **State Management**: Custom undo/redo system with history tracking
- **Data Persistence**: JSON import/export
- **Styling**: CSS3 with CSS variables for theming

## Architecture Highlights

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models**: Data structures and constants
- **State**: Global state management and persistence
- **Canvas**: All rendering and drawing operations
- **Operations**: System manipulation logic
- **UI**: Event handling and user interactions
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities
