# Building Recipe Validation Report

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

**Validation completed for 196 buildings** that require native-system resource availability:
- **Resource Tier 2 buildings (T1-T3)**: 132 buildings
- **Infrastructure T1 buildings**: 64 buildings

### Key Findings
- ✅ **63 buildings (32%)** work perfectly in all compatible systems
- ⚠️ **104 buildings (53%)** work in some but not all systems  
- ❌ **29 buildings (15%)** cannot be built in ANY compatible system

**Average validation rate: 47%** - meaning on average, buildings can only be constructed in about half of their intended systems.

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action**

### 29 Buildings with 0% Validation Rate
These buildings **cannot be constructed in any system** where they're supposed to be buildable:

**Most Critical Examples:**
- All Aluminum Processor variants (T1-T3)
- All Boron Processor variants (T1-T3) 
- All Lithium Processor variants (T1-T3)
- Multiple Ore Extractors (Aluminum, Boron, Lithium, Methane)
- Several Infrastructure Hub buildings

**Root Cause**: These buildings require resources that simply don't exist on the planet types where they're meant to be built.

## 📊 **Problem Resource Analysis**

### Top 10 Most Problematic Resources

| Rank | Resource | Buildings Affected | Avg % Systems Missing | Severity Score |
|------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| 1 | **Boron Ore** | 31 | 58% | 1,798 |
| 2 | **Tin Ore** | 26 | 59% | 1,534 |
| 3 | **Tritium Ore** | 23 | 56% | 1,288 |
| 4 | **Quartz Crystals** | 23 | 56% | 1,288 |
| 5 | **Scandium Ore** | 18 | 60% | 1,080 |
| 6 | **Silicon Crystal** | 18 | 54% | 972 |
| 7 | **Iron Ore** | 16 | 56% | 896 |
| 8 | **Silver Ore** | 11 | 81% | 891 |
| 9 | **Silica** | 27 | 31% | 837 |
| 10 | **Abyssal Chromite** | 12 | 63% | 756 |

**Key Insight**: The top 6 resources account for issues in **139 building instances**. Fixing these would resolve the majority of problems.

## 📈 **Validation Rate Distribution**

- **100% valid**: 63 buildings ✅
- **75-99% valid**: 0 buildings  
- **50-74% valid**: 2 buildings (Hafnium Processors)
- **25-49% valid**: 52 buildings ⚠️
- **1-24% valid**: 50 buildings ❌
- **0% valid**: 29 buildings 🚫

**Pattern**: Most buildings either work perfectly (100%) or have significant issues (<50%). Very few buildings have minor problems.

## 🏗️ **Problem Breakdown by Building Category**

### Resource Tier 2 Buildings (T1-T3)
- **125 problem buildings** out of 132 total
- **Average validation rate: 24%**
- **Main issues**: Boron Ore (31 buildings), Silica (27 buildings), Tin Ore (26 buildings)

### Infrastructure T1 Buildings  
- **8 problem buildings** out of 64 total
- **Average validation rate: 0%** (these are the worst)
- **Main issue**: Complete mismatch between required resources and available planet types

## 🎯 **Actionable Recommendations**

### Priority 1: CRITICAL - Complete Recipe Overhaul (29 buildings)
**Buildings that cannot be built anywhere**

**Actions Required:**
1. **Review planet type assignments** - Some buildings may be on wrong planet types
2. **Replace ALL problematic components** with alternatives that exist on target planets
3. **Consider relocating buildings** to planet types where their resources are available

**Examples needing immediate fixes:**
- Aluminum/Boron/Lithium Processors (all tiers)
- Multiple Ore Extractors 
- Several Infrastructure Hubs

### Priority 2: HIGH - Resource Substitution (Top 6 Resources)
**Fix the most impactful resource problems**

**Target Resources for Replacement:**
1. **Boron Ore** → Find alternative available on more planet types (affects 31 buildings)
2. **Tin Ore** → Create faction-specific variants (affects 26 buildings) 
3. **Tritium Ore** → Replace with more common resource (affects 23 buildings)
4. **Quartz Crystals** → Find crystal alternative on common planets (affects 23 buildings)
5. **Scandium Ore** → Replace with different metal ore (affects 18 buildings)
6. **Silicon Crystal** → Use alternative crystal/mineral (affects 18 buildings)

### Priority 3: HIGH - Major Recipe Adjustment (50 buildings)
**Buildings with <25% validation rate need significant changes**

**Strategy:**
- Replace the **1-2 most problematic components** per building
- Focus on components requiring rare planet types
- Maintain thematic consistency while improving availability

## 🛠️ **Implementation Strategy**

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Week 1-2)
Focus on the 29 buildings with 0% validation rate:
1. **Audit planet type assignments** - verify buildings are on correct planets
2. **Component substitution** - replace impossible-to-obtain components
3. **Quick testing** - validate fixes work in target systems

### Phase 2: High-Impact Resource Fixes (Week 3-4)  
Target the top 6 problematic resources:
1. **Research alternatives** for Boron Ore, Tin Ore, Tritium Ore, etc.
2. **Create new component variants** if needed
3. **Update affected recipes** systematically

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
Address remaining 50 buildings with low validation rates:
1. **Incremental improvements** - replace 1-2 components per building
2. **Validation testing** - ensure improvements work
3. **Thematic review** - maintain game balance and theme
