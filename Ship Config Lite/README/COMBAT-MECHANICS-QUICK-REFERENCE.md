# Combat Mechanics Quick Reference

## Current vs Expected Behavior

### üéØ Alpha Effects
**Current:**
- Alpha Strike: +X% damage on round 1, action 0, for first striker only
- Alpha Shield: +X% shield points at battle start for defender

**Expected:**
- Alpha Strike: +X% damage on initiator's first attack only (one-time use)
- Alpha Shield: -X% damage reduction on first incoming attack only (one-time use)

### ‚è±Ô∏è Turn System
**Current:**
- AP determines actions per round
- Must use all available AP each round
- Strict alternating turns

**Expected:**
- Cooldown timers gate attacks
- Attack only when cooldown <= 0
- Both can act in same round

### üî´ Ammo System
**Current:**
```javascript
maxRounds = Math.floor(ammoCapacity / 10);
canFire = currentRound <= maxRounds;
```

**Expected:**
```javascript
canAttack = ammo > 0 && cooldownTimer <= 0;
onAttack: ammo -= ammoPerAttack;
```

### üèÅ End Conditions
**Current:**
1. One fleet HP <= 0 ‚Üí Other wins
2. 100 rounds ‚Üí Compare HP

**Expected:**
1. One fleet HP <= 0 ‚Üí Other wins
2. Both HP <= 0 same round ‚Üí Mutual destruction
3. Both alive, both ammo = 0 ‚Üí Stalemate

## Key Implementation Notes

### Round Processing Order
1. Tick all cooldown timers down
2. Check who can attack (cooldown ready + has ammo)
3. Process all valid attacks simultaneously
4. Apply damage and effects
5. Check for deaths/end conditions
6. Apply end-of-round effects (shield regen, etc.)

### Alpha Effect Rules
- **Initiator** = whoever starts the combat (parameter)
- **First Attack** = first successful attack attempt
- Each alpha effect can only be used ONCE per battle
- Track with boolean flags: `firstAttackUsed`, `alphaShieldUsed`

### Damage Pipeline (First Attack)
1. Calculate base damage
2. IF attacker is initiator AND first attack ‚Üí Apply alpha strike multiplier
3. IF defender has alpha shield available ‚Üí Apply alpha shield reduction
4. Apply other modifiers (diversity, etc.)
5. Clamp to minimum if needed

### Stalemate Detection
```javascript
if (leftHP > 0 && rightHP > 0 && leftAmmo === 0 && rightAmmo === 0) {
  return 'STALEMATE';
}
```

## Combat State Tracking

### Per-Fleet State
```javascript
{
  // Combat stats
  hp: number,
  shields: number,
  
  // Resources
  ammo: number,
  
  // Cooldowns
  attackCooldown: number,      // Base cooldown (e.g., 2 rounds)
  cooldownTimer: number,       // Current timer (counts down)
  
  // Alpha tracking
  isInitiator: boolean,        // Is this fleet the initiator?
  firstAttackUsed: boolean,    // Has used first attack?
  alphaShieldUsed: boolean,    // Has used alpha shield?
  
  // Skills
  alphaStrikeLevel: 0-4,
  alphaShieldLevel: 0-4
}
```

### Global Combat State
```javascript
{
  round: number,
  combatLog: Array,
  initiatorFleet: 'left' | 'right',
  battleResult: null | 'WIN' | 'MUTUAL_DESTRUCTION' | 'STALEMATE'
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Alpha One-Time
- A attacks with alpha strike ‚Üí +damage
- A attacks again ‚Üí no bonus
- B defends first attack ‚Üí alpha shield reduces damage
- B defends second attack ‚Üí no reduction

### Scenario 2: Cooldown Blocking
- Fleet has ammo but cooldown = 1
- Cannot attack this round
- Next round cooldown = 0, can attack

### Scenario 3: Simultaneous Combat
- Both fleets have cooldown = 0
- Both attack in same round
- Damage resolves simultaneously
- Could result in mutual destruction

### Scenario 4: Ammo Stalemate
- Both fleets alive
- Both run out of ammo
- Battle ends in stalemate

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't apply alpha shield as HP/shield boost** - it's damage reduction
2. **Don't force AP spending** - respect cooldowns
3. **Don't skip mutual destruction check** - both can die together
4. **Don't use rounds for ammo** - track per attack
5. **Don't make turns strictly sequential** - allow simultaneity

## Balance Guidelines

- Default configs should rarely one-shot
- Cooldowns create tactical pacing
- Ammo limits prevent infinite battles
- Alpha effects reward initiative without guaranteeing victory
- Stalemates are valid outcomes for evenly matched fleets
